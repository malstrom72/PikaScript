<p>PikaScript grew out of experiments to create the tiniest possible scripting language. The first prototype, PicoScript, was written in just a few days and represented all values as strings. It supported basic C-style expressions and treated all statements as expressions too. Variable references were added early, but the initial approach&#8212;using ^ to count call-frame distance&#8212;quickly ran into problems. It wasn&#8217;t safe to store such references in global variables.</p>
<p>To address this, the language evolved into PikoScript. It assigned numeric depth levels to each frame and embedded that into reference values and closures. References like @:3:x became possible, and variable types were upgraded to a proper union of bool, double, and dynamically allocated string. But the added complexity worked against the original goal of minimalism.</p>
<p>So the project was stripped back again as YoctoScript. Frame references were dropped entirely, along with ternary ?:, while, and do loops. All variables were global except locals marked with a $ prefix. Values were again just strings. This version was extremely simple, but the lack of local scopes and structured references made it hard to do anything non-trivial.</p>
<p>PikaScript, the final version, aimed for a balance. It reintroduced frames and references, but with globally unique frame identifiers rather than relative depths. This eliminated the need for checking up/down access rules and allowed closures to work more reliably. It also added features like variable enumeration (enabling foreach), the ^ prefix for accessing caller frames, and other structural improvements&#8212;all while keeping the interpreter under a thousand lines of standard C++ with no heap allocations and no garbage collection.</p>
<p>The first product to ship with PikaScript was Synplant 1.0, where it controlled GUI interaction with the plugin backend.</p>
<p>In Microtonic 3.0, released in early 2011, PikaScript was exposed to users for the first time. Dropping .pika files into a special folder added them to a cog-wheel menu, where they could be launched to automate repetitive tasks like patch exports, pattern randomisation, or batch editing. The first official script pack was released in May that year.</p>
<p>Newer Sonic Charge plug-ins now use a custom JavaScript engine instead (NuXJS), but PikaScript is still supported for legacy scripts and internal tools. The core language has remained unchanged since 2008.</p>
