What is htmlify?
================

 htmlify is a lightweight text to HTML converter implemented in PikaScript. It takes plain text formatted with a minimal
markup language and outputs corresponding HTML. The script is mainly used to convert the documentation in this
repository from `.txt` sources into the `docs/help` HTML pages and `PikaScript Documentation.html`.

Markup Syntax
-------------

 The converter recognizes a small set of conventions:

 -  Paragraphs indented 1–3 spaces are unwrapped while four or more spaces create `<pre>` blocks.
 -  A header is created when a line of text is followed by a line of `#`, `=` or `-` of the same length.
 -  `*bold*`, `/italic/` and `_underline_` produce `<b>`, `<i>` and `<u>` respectively.
 -  Backtick quoted sections ``code`` become `<tt>` blocks.
 -  `name.txt` and `name.html` are turned into links to `name.html`.
 -  Lists start with `*`, `-` or digits followed by `.` and may be nested using indentation.
 -  Tables are created by aligning columns with two spaces or more.
 -  Tables support header rows using a dashed line and row headers using `:` surrounded by spaces.
 -  A line of ten or more `=` characters by itself inserts a horizontal rule.
 -  Plain `http://` or `https://` links are automatically converted to `<a href>` tags.
 -  Writing `[image.jpg]` (or `.png`, `.gif`) embeds the image; remote URLs inside brackets work too.
 -  Referencing a header name exactly creates an internal link to that section if it appears elsewhere.
 -  A `^` sequence forms superscript like `x^2`; spaces around the caret are not allowed.
 -  Appending one or more `*` to a word marks a footnote and the text `**` defines it later.

 Any text that does not match a special pattern is HTML escaped to ensure valid output. Source files are assumed to be
encoded with UTF-8.

 Headers become <h1>, <h2> or <h3> respectively and automatically turn into named anchors that can be referenced simply
by writing the exact words again elsewhere.


Example Usage
-------------

 To convert a document you load `htmlify.pika` and call the `htmlify` function with the text to process. Below is the
minimal command used by this project to generate the main documentation:

     include('tools/htmlify.pika');
     src = load('docs/PikaScript Documentation.txt');
     html = htmlify(src);
     save('docs/PikaScript Documentation.html', html);

 A helper script `tools/htmlifyFile.pika` performs the same conversion from the command line. Pass the text file and
optionally a CSS file:

    output/PikaCmd tools/htmlifyFile.pika README.txt custom.css


Known Limitations
-----------------

 -  Trailing spaces may affect formatting, particularly inside preformatted blocks.
 -  The implementation is tuned for this repository and may require adjustments for other input conventions.

Example Document
----------------

 The following text demonstrates most features of `htmlify`.

Main Header
###########

First Chapter
=============

Introduction
------------

Welcome you, welcome, welcome, welcome. I have absolutely nothing to say, so here goes nothing...

We have two paragraphs.

No, three paragraphs.
And this one is broken into several
lines.

   If a paragraph
starts with one to three spaces of
indentation it will be "unwrapped"
until...
   The next indented line.

 You can write *bold* statements. And _underline_ of course. /Italic/ is written just like that. Enclose text in "grave
accents" for teletype, `like this`.

Urls, like http://www.soniccharge.com automatically turns into href's.

A single line of `==========` (at least 10 of them) creates a horizontal divider.

======================================================================================================================

 If you write the exact name of a header in this file it will become a reference. Like this: see Interesting Fruits. But
only if this section isn't under the header you reference. So Main Header, First Chapter and Introduction won't become
references right now.

Local images can be inserted like this:

[sleigh.jpg]

(recognized extensions are `jpg`, `png` and `gif`).

You can also insert remote images like this: [http://www.soniccharge.com/images/flags/SE.png]

 Local `.txt` and `.html` files can be referenced by simply writing a filename anywhere like this: test.txt. You can
even reference an anchor inside a local html file. For example: test.html#Interesting_Fruits.

 `^` can be used for superscript in mathematical expressions, for example: x^3*5 + x^(7 * y). (Requirement: no space
around `^` but at least one space somewhere before next `^`.)

One or more asterisks after a word creates a reference to a footnote**...

** which must be defined sooner or later

Interesting Fruits
------------------

 Lists are identified by 1), 2), 3) etc (for ordered lists) and *) or - (for unordered lists). With proper indentation
you can create lists beneath other lists.

1)  Apple
    Is `good`

    /for/ *you*
2)  Orange

        Beginning of sub-list

        *) Hey
        1) sub-list
        2) yeah
    *) You
    *) The *rock* steady /crew/

        End of sub-list

3)  Banana
    - boat
        - party
          *) night
          tonight
        - keep this
          hard wrap
        -  soften this
          wrap
          and this wrap
           but break before but there
          but not here

          and extra space
          before this section of two lines

4)  http://www.soniccharge.com. Cool place to hang out.

1) one
2) two
3) three

Examples
--------

 Examples are indented by four or more spaces and they will be put into <pre> </pre> sections. Take a look at the
following example:

    This is an example.
    +-----------------------------+
    |It uses a preformatted style.|
    +-----------------------------+

    and it continues to here.

But stops here.

Table Examples
--------------

 Tables are created when a section contains a line with two or more consecutive spaces. These spaces divide the cells
horizontally.

This is a table without headers:

various     things      arranged
in          a           three
by          three       square

Cells can expand horizontally like this:

  this is a long cell
  shorter  cells  here
           double cell
  just 1

This is a table with column headers:

Year        Xylophones      Rusty nails     Unpolished bicycles
----        ----------      -----------     -------------------
1972  :     309             17              5.5
1979  :     292             21293921        0
1993  :     N/A             1               -5
                                            /(returned five)/
2009  :     - " -           2               10

This is a table with row headers (remember, at least two spaces before and after `:`):

First attempt   :   failed miserably
Second attempt  :   things are getting better
Third attempt   :   wooh, we are getting close now
Fourth attempt  :   oh no, back to square 1
