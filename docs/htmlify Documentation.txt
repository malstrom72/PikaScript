What is htmlify?
================

 htmlify is a lightweight text to HTML converter implemented in PikaScript. It takes plain
 text formatted with a minimal markup language and outputs corresponding HTML. The script is
 mainly used to convert the documentation in this repository from `.txt` sources into the
 `docs/help` HTML pages and `PikaScript Documentation.html`.

Markup Syntax
-------------

 The converter recognizes a small set of conventions:

 -  Lines consisting solely of `#`, `=` or `-` create headers `<h1>`, `<h2>` and `<h3>`.
 -  `*bold*`, `/italic/` and `_underline_` produce `<b>`, `<i>` and `<u>` respectively.
 -  Backtick quoted sections ``code`` become `<tt>` blocks.
 -  `name.txt` and `name.html` are turned into links to `name.html`.
 -  Lists start with `*`, `-` or digits followed by `.` and may be nested using indentation.
 -  Tables are created by aligning columns with two spaces or more.
 -  `==========` inserts a horizontal rule.

 Any text that does not match a special pattern is HTML escaped to ensure valid output.

Example Usage
-------------

 To convert a document you load `htmlify.pika` and call the `htmlify` function with the
 text to process. Below is the minimal command used by this project to generate the main
 documentation:

     include('tools/htmlify.pika');
     src = load('docs/PikaScript Documentation.txt');
     html = htmlify(src);
     save('docs/PikaScript Documentation.html', html);

 A helper script `tools/htmlifyFile.pika` performs the same conversion from the command line. Pass the text file and optionally a CSS file:

     PikaCmd tools/htmlifyFile.pika README.txt custom.css


Known Limitations
-----------------

 -  Trailing spaces may affect formatting, particularly inside preformatted blocks.
 -  The implementation is tuned for this repository and may require adjustments for other
    input conventions.
