	STLValue is the reference implementation of a PikaScript variable. Internally, all values are represented by an STL
	compliant string class \p S *. This class actually inherits from \p S (with public inheritance) for optimization
	reasons. This way we avoid a lot of unnecessary temporary objects when we cast to and from strings. (Unfortunately
	it is not possible to make this inheritance private and add conversion operators to the \p S class. Explicit
	conversion operators in C++ have lower priority than implicit base class conversions.)
	
	Although it may seem inefficient to store all variables in textual representation it makes PikaScript easy to
	interface with and debug for. With the custom value <-> text conversion routines in PikaScript the performance isn't
	too bad. It mainly depends on the performance of the string implementation which is the reason why this class is a
	template. The standard variant of STLValue uses std::string, but you may want to "plug in" a more efficient class.
		
	STLValue supports construction from and casting to the following C++ types:

	- \c bool
	- \c int
	- \c uint
	- \c long
	- \c ulong
	- \c float
	- \c double
	- the template string class \p S

	\note
	* PikaScript only requires a specific subset of the STL string features. Utility member functions (such as \c
	find_first_of) are never used (instead, the equivalent generic STL algorithms are utilized). Destructive functions
	such as \c insert and \c erase are not used either. Furthermore, PikaScript consider all string access through the
	subscript operator [] to be for reading only (therefore only a \c const function for this operator is required).

		We provide two Native template classes for bridging PikaScript calls to C++ "functors". One that takes a single

		has an overloaded operator() or a C / C++ function. It is a concept introduced to C++ with STL so please refer
		to your STL documentation of choice for more info. (For example: http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/functors.html )
		
		Thanks to some clever template tricks, these classes are very flexible when it comes to what type of arguments
		your functor can take and what type it may return. Here are your options:
		
		- Any argument can be of a type that is convertible from Script::Value (e.g., \c bool, \c long, \c double etc).
		- Likewise, the functor can return any type that is convertible to a Script::Value.
		- You can also use a functor with \c void result type.
		- The functor may take a single argument type of Script::Frame&. You can then retrieve all the arguments for
		the call by reading \c $0, \c $1, \c $2 etc from the Frame (via Frame::get() or Frame::getOptional()).
		
		In Frame you will find a template function (Frame::registerNative()) that allows you to register a native C++
		function directly through a functor. It will construct the proper functor instance for you "in the background".

		If you need use examples, please see the standard library implementation in PikaScriptImpl.h.

		getThisAndMethod splits the \c $callee variable of \p frame into object ("this") and method. The returned value

		Notice that if the $callee variable does not begin with a "frame specifier", it is assumed that the object
		belongs to the previous frame (e.g. the caller of the method). This holds true even if the method is actually
		defined in the root frame. For example \code function { obj.meth() } \endcode would trigger an error even if
		\c ::obj is defined since \c obj isn't defined in our function. While \code function { ::obj.meth() } \endcode
		works.
		
		One common use for this function is in a PikaScript object constructor for extracting the "this" reference
		that should be constructed. Another situation where this routine is useful is if you use the "elevate" function
		to aggregate various methods into a single C++ function. You may then use this function to extract the method
