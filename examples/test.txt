Main Header
###########

First Chapter
=============

Introduction
------------

Welcome you, welcome, welcome, welcome. I have absolutely nothing to say, so here goes nothing...

We have two paragraphs.

No, three paragraphs.
And this one is broken into several
lines.

   If a paragraph
starts with one to three spaces of
indentation it will be "unwrapped"
until...
   The next indented line.

You can write *bold* statements. And _underline_ of course. /Italic/ is written just like that. Enclose text in "grave accents" for teletype, `like this`.

Urls, like http://www.soniccharge.com automatically turns into href's.

A single line of `==========` (at least 10 of them) creates a horizontal divider.

=======================================================================================================================================

If you write the exact name of a header in this file it will become a reference. Like this: see Interesting Fruits. But only if this section isn't under the header you reference. So Main Header, First Chapter and Introduction won't become references right now.

Local images can be inserted like this:

[sleigh.jpg]

(recognized extensions are `jpg`, `png` and `gif`).

You can also insert remote images like this: [http://www.soniccharge.com/images/flags/SE.png]

Local `.txt` and `.html` files can be referenced by simply writing a filename anywhere like this: test.txt. You can even reference an anchor inside a local html file. For example: test.html#Interesting_Fruits.

`^` can be used for superscript in mathematical expressions, for example: x^3*5 + x^(7 * y). (Requirement: no space around `^` but at least one space somewhere before next `^`.)

One or more asterisks after a word creates a reference to a footnote**...

** which must be defined sooner or later

Interesting Fruits
------------------

Lists are identified by 1), 2), 3) etc (for ordered lists) and *) or - (for unordered lists). With proper indentation you can create lists beneath other lists.

1)  Apple
    Is `good`
    
    /for/ *you*
2)  Orange
    
	Beginning of sub-list
	
	*) Hey
        1) sub-list
        2) yeah
    *) You
    *) The *rock* steady /crew/
	
	End of sub-list
	
3)  Banana
    - boat
	- party
	  *) night
	  tonight
	- keep this
	  hard wrap
	-  soften this
	  wrap
	  and this wrap
	   but break before but there
	  but not here
	  
	  and extra space
	  before this section of two lines
    
4)  http://www.soniccharge.com. Cool place to hang out.

1) one
2) two
3) three

Examples
--------

Examples are indented by four or more spaces and they will be put into <pre> </pre> sections. Take a look at the following example:

    This is an example.
    +-----------------------------+
    |It uses a preformatted style.|
    +-----------------------------+
    
    and it continues to here.

But stops here.

Tables
------

Tables are created when a section contains a line with two or more consecutive spaces. These spaces divide the cells horizontally.

This is a table without headers:

various     things      arranged
in          a           three
by          three       square

Cells can expand horizontally like this:

  this is a long cell
  shorter  cells  here
           double cell
  just 1

This is a table with column headers:

Year        Xylophones      Rusty nails     Unpolished bicycles
----        ----------      -----------     -------------------
1972  :     309             17              5.5
1979  :     292             21293921        0
1993  :     N/A             1               -5
                                            /(returned five)/
2009  :     - " -           2               10

This is a table with row headers (remember, at least two spaces before and after `:`):

First attempt   :   failed miserably
Second attempt  :   things are getting better
Third attempt   :   wooh, we are getting close now
Fourth attempt  :   oh no, back to square 1
