# Repository Guidelines

To run the test suite use the helper script with up to three minutes allowed for execution:

```bash
timeout 180 ./build.sh
```

Always execute this command before committing changes to verify that the build and regression tests succeed.

## Repository layout
The project uses a consistent folder structure. Build output is written to `output/` and no source files live there. Useful locations:

- `tools/` - scripts for building and maintaining the code and documentation.
- `projects/` - Xcode and Visual Studio project files.
- `docs/` - documentation.
- `externals/` - projects and source code from other repositories (only touch this content when explicitly asked to).
- `src/` - C++ source code for the library. The library is distributed as source rather than prebuilt binaries.
- `tests/` - regression tests.
- `examples/` - small sample programs.
- `benchmarks/` - JavaScript performance tests.
- `output/` - contains only build artifacts (and any runtime dependencies), no source files.

Root-level `build.sh` and `build.cmd` (mirrored implementations) should build and test both the beta and release targets.

BuildCpp.sh and BuildCpp.cmd are copied from another repository. Only make changes to them if there is no other solution.

## Coding style

Code style, design principles and commit messages follow [docs/CodingStyle.md](docs/CodingStyle.md), including the
PikaScript exceptions in its "Local additions" section.

Commit messages:
- Short imperative subject, little or no body. Add a body only when the why is not visible in the diff itself.
- No attribution trailers. No `Co-Authored-By` for tools or agents, no generated-with footers.

When handling files with command-line tools (which may break tab characters):
- Always run `expand -t 4` on the file before processing.
- Always run `unexpand -t 4` on the file after processing.

## Script portability

All user-facing `.sh` and `.cmd` files must work when launched from any directory.
They should start by changing to their own folder (or the repository root) so that
relative paths resolve correctly.

`.sh` scripts must be runnable without requiring `chmod +x`; always invoke them with  
`bash path/to/script.sh` (do **not** rely on the system-default `sh`).  
Each script must start with a portable she-bang:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e -o pipefail -u
```

Every `.sh` script must have a corresponding `.cmd` implementation with identical behavior. Use `.cmd` files rather than `.bat`.

```
# example for a shell script
cd "$(dirname "$0")"/..
```

REM example for a .cmd script  
```
CD /D "%~dp0\.."
```

For robust error handling, `.sh` scripts should begin as shown above, and `.cmd`
scripts normally use a simple error check:

```
CALL buildAndTest.cmd %target% || GOTO error
EXIT /b 0
:error
EXIT /b %ERRORLEVEL%
```

## Generated source files

Some files in the repository are produced by helper scripts and should not be edited manually.

- `tools/PikaCmd/BuiltIns.cpp` is created by running `tools/PikaCmd/UpdateBuiltIns.pika` with `PikaCmd`.
- `tools/PikaCmd/SourceDistribution/PikaCmdAmalgam.cpp` results from concatenating sources using `tools/PikaCmd/UpdateSourceDistribution.sh`.
- `docs/PikaScript Documentation.html` is generated from `PikaScript Documentation.txt` via `tools/UpdateHtmlDox.pika`.

Regenerate these files using the scripts whenever their inputs change.
